        <p class="verse">I found a love, for me</p>
        <p class="verse">Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead</p>
        <p class="verse">Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet</p>
        <p class="verse">Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me</p>
        <p class="verse">â€˜Cause we were just kids when we fell in love</p>
        <p class="verse">Not knowing what it was</p>
        <p class="verse">I will not give you up this time</p>
        <p class="verse">But darling, just kiss me slow</p>
        <p class="verse">Your heart is all I own</p>
        <p class="verse">And in your eyes, you're holding mine</p>
        <p class="chorus">Baby, I'm dancing in the dark</p>
        <p class="chorus">With you between my arms</p>
        <p class="chorus">Barefoot on the grass</p>
        <p class="chorus">Listening to our favourite song</p>
        <p class="chorus">When you said you looked a mess</p>
        <p class="chorus">I whispered underneath my breath</p>
        <p class="chorus">But you heard it</p>
        <p class="chorus">Darling, you look perfect tonight</p>
        <p class="verse">Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know</p>
        <p class="verse">She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home</p>
        <p class="verse">I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets</p>
        <p class="verse">To carry love, to carry children of our own</p>
        <p class="verse">We are still kids, but we're so in love</p>
        <p class="verse">Fighting against all odds</p>
        <p class="verse">I know we'll be alright this time</p>
        <p class="verse">Darling, just hold my hand</p>
        <p class="verse">Be my girl, I'll be your man</p>
        <p class="verse">I see my future in your eyes</p>
        <p class="chorus">Baby, I'm dancing in the dark</p>
        <p class="chorus">With you between my arms</p>
        <p class="chorus">Barefoot on the grass</p>
        <p class="chorus">Listening to our favorite song</p>
        <p class="chorus">When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful</p>
        <p class="chorus">I don't deserve this</p>
        <p class="chorus">Darling, you look perfect tonight</p>
        <p class="chorus">Baby, I'm dancing in the dark</p>
        <p class="chorus">With you between my arms</p>
        <p class="chorus">Barefoot on the grass</p>
        <p class="chorus">Listening to our favorite song</p>
        <p class="verse">I have faith in what I see</p>
        <p class="verse">Now I know I have met an angel in person</p>
        <p class="verse">And she looks perfect</p>
        <p class="verse">I don't deserve this</p>
        <p class="verse">You look perfect tonight</p>
